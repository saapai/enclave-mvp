# SMS Bot Status - Conversation Features

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Conversation History**
- Stores last 3 messages per phone number
- Isolated per user (no cross-contamination)
- Conversation context included in all AI calls

### 2. **Intent Detection**
- **Chat**: Casual greetings ('what's up', 'hey', etc.)
- **Content Queries**: Questions about SEP/events
- **Smart Routing**: Chat queries about content ‚Üí provide content

### 3. **Multi-Document Search**
- Searches across ALL SEP workspaces
- Iterates through ranked results
- Tries each document until finds relevant answer

### 4. **Dynamic Token Limits**
- **Broad queries** ('what's happening') ‚Üí 200 tokens
- **Specific queries** ('when is') ‚Üí 100 tokens
- **Default queries** ‚Üí 150 tokens

### 5. **AI Summarization**
- Chunks documents (1500 chars with 200 char overlap)
- Searches through ALL chunks until finds answer
- Falls back if no relevant content found

### 6. **Planner System**
- Tries knowledge graph first
- Falls back to doc search with AI summarization
- Context-aware responses

## üéØ HOW IT WORKS NOW

**Example Conversation:**
```
User: "When is active meeting?"
Bot: "Every Wednesday at 8 PM at Mahi's (461B Kelton)." [Saved to history]

User: "Where?" [Follow-up]
Bot: [Gets conversation context from history, understands we're talking about active meeting]
Bot: "Mahi's apartment at 461B Kelton." [Provides context-aware answer]

User: "What's going on with sep?"
Bot: [Recognizes as content query, searches docs, summarizes findings]
Bot: "Active Meeting every Wed at 8 PM, Study Hall Wed 6:30 PM..." [Comprehensive answer]
```

## üìä QUERY TYPES

| Query Type | Intent | Search Strategy | Token Limit |
|------------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| "What's up" | Chat | Casual response | N/A |
| "What's going on with sep" | Content | Multi-doc AI summary | 150 |
| "What's happening this week" | Content | Multi-doc AI summary (broad) | 200 |
| "When is active meeting" | Event | Knowledge graph ‚Üí docs | 100 |
| "Where is it?" | Follow-up | Conversation-aware doc search | 100 |

## üîß NEXT STEPS TO ACTIVATE

1. **Run Conversation History Schema:**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   -- File: database/sms-conversation-history-schema.sql
   ```

2. **Run Knowledge Graph Fix:**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   -- File: database/fix-knowledge-graph-functions.sql
   ```

3. **Populate Knowledge Graph:**
   ```bash
   ./run-consolidator.sh
   # Or via API
   curl -X POST https://www.tryenclave.com/api/internal/consolidate \
     -H "x-api-key: YOUR_KEY" \
     -d '{"workspaceId":"YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID"}'
   ```

## üé® CURRENT BEHAVIOR

**Works Well:**
- ‚úÖ Conversation history tracking
- ‚úÖ Multi-document search
- ‚úÖ Chat vs content detection
- ‚úÖ Dynamic token limits
- ‚úÖ Cross-workspace searching

**Needs Work:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "What's going on with sep" should return comprehensive SEP info
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Chat responses could be more contextual based on history
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Knowledge graph SQL needs to be run in production

## üöÄ FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

1. **Better Follow-up Handling**
   - "where?" should understand from context
   - "when?" should reference previous event discussions

2. **Proactive Summaries**
   - Weekly recap of upcoming events
   - Deadline reminders
   - Policy updates

3. **Multi-turn Context**
   - "That's study hall, when's active?" ‚Üí Should understand correction
   - Maintain conversation state across multiple messages

4. **Event Intelligence**
   - "What's happening this Wednesday?" ‚Üí Filter by day
   - "Upcoming deadlines?" ‚Üí Extract from documents
