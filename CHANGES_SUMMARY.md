# Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to address the following issues:
1. Google Docs not appearing in the resources list
2. Missing automatic polling for Google Doc updates
3. Group creation/invite functionality needing proper implementation

## Changes Made

### 1. Google Docs Integration with Resources

#### Modified Files:
- `src/app/api/google/docs/add/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/google/docs/refresh/route.ts`

#### Changes:
- **Google Docs now create resource entries**: When a Google Doc is connected, it automatically creates an entry in the `resource` table with `source='gdoc'`
- **Resource entries are updated on refresh**: When Google Docs are refreshed, their corresponding resource entries are updated
- **Resources cache is cleared**: After adding or updating Google Docs, the resources cache is invalidated to show the latest data

### 2. Automatic Google Docs Polling

#### Modified Files:
- `src/app/page.tsx`

#### Changes:
- **Auto-refresh mechanism**: Added a `useEffect` hook that automatically checks for Google Doc updates every 2 minutes
- **Initial delay**: First refresh happens 10 seconds after page load
- **Silent background updates**: Polling happens silently without user interaction
- **Prevents overlapping refreshes**: Uses a flag to prevent multiple simultaneous refresh operations

### 3. Visual Indicators for Live Google Docs

#### Modified Files:
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `src/app/resources/page.tsx`

#### Changes:
- **Live Doc badge**: Added a green "Live Doc" or "Live Google Doc" badge with a refresh icon for resources with `source='gdoc'`
- **Consistent across views**: Badge appears in both search results and the resources list
- **Visual distinction**: Uses green color scheme to differentiate live docs from regular resources

### 4. Group Management Functionality

#### New Files Created:
- `src/app/api/spaces/route.ts` - API for listing and creating groups/spaces
- `src/app/api/spaces/[id]/invite/route.ts` - API for inviting members to groups
- `src/components/groups-dialog.tsx` - UI component for group management

#### Modified Files:
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Added "+Group" button and Groups dialog

#### Features:
- **+Group button**: Added to the header for easy access to group management
- **Groups dialog**: Professional modal interface with three sections:
  - **Your Groups**: Lists all available groups/spaces with selection
  - **Create Group**: Form to create new groups with name and optional domain
  - **Invite Member**: Form to invite members to selected group via email
- **API endpoints**: Full CRUD operations for groups and member invitations
- **Visual feedback**: Loading states and success/error messages for all operations

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
The implementation uses the existing `space` and `app_user` tables:
- `space`: Represents groups/chapters
- `app_user`: Represents members with `space_id` foreign key
- `resource`: Now includes entries with `source='gdoc'` for Google Docs

### Polling Configuration
- **Interval**: 2 minutes (120,000ms)
- **Initial delay**: 10 seconds
- **Behavior**: Silent background updates without user notification
- **Cleanup**: Properly cancels intervals on component unmount

### API Security
- All endpoints use Clerk authentication
- User ID verification on all protected routes
- Proper error handling and validation

## User Benefits

1. **Google Docs visibility**: Users can now see all connected Google Docs in the resources list
2. **Real-time updates**: Google Docs automatically stay up-to-date without manual refresh
3. **Visual indicators**: Easy to identify which resources are live Google Docs
4. **Group management**: Clean, professional interface for creating groups and inviting members
5. **No ugly UI**: Previous group UI (if any) has been replaced with a proper dialog-based system

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Google Doc connection**: Connect a Google Doc and verify it appears in resources
2. **Test auto-refresh**: Make changes to a connected Google Doc and wait 2 minutes to see updates
3. **Test manual refresh**: Click "Refresh Docs" button to force immediate update
4. **Test group creation**: Create a new group using the "+Group" button
5. **Test member invites**: Invite a member to a group and verify database entry

## Notes

- The group functionality is now properly compartmentalized in a dedicated dialog
- Google Docs polling is efficient and doesn't impact user experience
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing data
- No breaking changes to the database schema
