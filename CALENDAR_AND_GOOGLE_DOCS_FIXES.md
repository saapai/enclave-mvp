# üîß CALENDAR AND GOOGLE DOCS FIXES

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Calendar Events ON CONFLICT Error**
- **Problem**: `'there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification'`
- **Cause**: Trying to use `upsert` with `onConflict: 'url'` but resource table doesn't have unique constraint on url
- **Fix**: Changed to simple `insert` instead of `upsert`

### 2. **Calendar Search Not Working**
- **Problem**: Calendar events were syncing but not searchable
- **Cause**: Search function didn't have user filtering for personal workspace isolation
- **Fix**: Created `fix-calendar-search-user-filtering.sql` migration

### 3. **Google Docs Search Not Working**
- **Problem**: Google Docs were not searchable
- **Cause**: Search function didn't have user filtering for personal workspace isolation  
- **Fix**: Created `fix-google-docs-search-user-filtering.sql` migration

## üöÄ REQUIRED ACTIONS

You need to run these 3 SQL migrations in Supabase:

### 1. **fix-calendar-search-user-filtering.sql**
```sql
-- Updates search_calendar_events_vector function
-- Adds user filtering for personal workspace
-- Maintains shared workspace functionality
```

### 2. **fix-google-docs-search-user-filtering.sql**
```sql
-- Updates search_google_docs_vector function  
-- Adds user filtering for personal workspace
-- Maintains shared workspace functionality
```

### 3. **fix-fts-search-user-filtering.sql** (if not already run)
```sql
-- Updates search_resources_fts function
-- Adds user filtering for personal workspace
-- Maintains shared workspace functionality
```

### 4. **fix-vector-search-user-filtering.sql** (if not already run)
```sql
-- Updates search_resources_vector function
-- Adds user filtering for personal workspace
-- Maintains shared workspace functionality
```

## üéØ Expected Results

After running these migrations:

‚úÖ **Calendar Events**: 
- Will sync successfully without ON CONFLICT errors
- Will be searchable in personal workspace (user's own events only)
- Will be searchable in shared workspaces (all events in that workspace)

‚úÖ **Google Docs**:
- Will be searchable in personal workspace (user's own docs only)
- Will be searchable in shared workspaces (all docs in that workspace)

‚úÖ **User Isolation**:
- Personal workspace: Users only see their own resources
- Shared workspaces: Users see all resources in that workspace
- No cross-contamination between different users' personal workspaces

## üîç How It Works

The search functions now use conditional user filtering:

```sql
-- For default workspace (personal), filter by user to ensure privacy
-- For custom workspaces, allow searching all resources in that workspace
WHERE (target_space_id != '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' 
       OR target_user_id IS NULL 
       OR added_by = target_user_id)
```

This ensures:
- **Personal workspace** (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`): Users only see their own resources
- **Custom workspaces**: Users see all resources in that workspace (shared access)

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Run the 4 SQL migrations** in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Test calendar sync** - should work without ON CONFLICT errors
3. **Test search functionality** - should work for both calendar and Google Docs
4. **Verify user isolation** - new users should only see their own resources in personal workspace

All fixes are now deployed to the codebase and ready for the database migrations! üéâ
