# Fixes Summary - Group Management & Google Docs

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Domain Field from Group Creation
**Problem**: The domain field was unnecessary in the group creation UI.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the domain input field from `groups-dialog.tsx`
- Updated the API call to only send the group name
- Simplified the form to one field: Group Name

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/groups-dialog.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Added Member List Display for Selected Groups
**Problem**: Users couldn't see who was in a group after selecting it.

**Solution**:
- Added a new "Group Members" section that appears when a group is selected
- Created API endpoint to fetch members for a specific group
- Displays member name, email, and role with a clean card-based UI
- Shows loading state while fetching members
- Shows "No members yet" message for empty groups

**Files Created**:
- `src/app/api/spaces/[id]/members/route.ts` - New API endpoint to fetch group members

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/groups-dialog.tsx` - Added member list UI and fetching logic

---

### 3. ✅ Filter Groups by User Email (Access Control)
**Problem**: All groups were visible to all users, regardless of whether they were invited.

**Solution**:
- Modified the spaces API to check user's email from Clerk
- Query the `app_user` table to find which groups the user belongs to
- Only return groups where the user's email matches an invited member
- Always includes the default space for all users
- Prevents unauthorized access to private groups

**How it Works**:
1. Get user's email from Clerk authentication
2. Look up `app_user` records matching that email
3. Extract the `space_id` values (groups they're in)
4. Only return those specific spaces plus the default space

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/spaces/route.ts` - Added email-based filtering logic

---

### 4. ✅ Fixed Google Doc Auto-Polling Not Working
**Problem**: Google Docs were not automatically refreshing even though polling was implemented. Manual refresh worked, but automatic updates didn't trigger.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Insufficient logging**: Couldn't see if polling was running
2. **Weak change detection**: Only checked revision ID, which might not update immediately
3. **No visibility**: Silent failures weren't reported

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### A. Enhanced Console Logging
Added detailed logging to track the auto-refresh lifecycle:
```
[Auto-Refresh] Starting Google Docs auto-refresh check...
[Auto-Refresh] Found 2 Google Doc(s) to check
[Auto-Refresh] Checking doc: Chapter Bylaws (uuid-123)
[Auto-Refresh] ✓ Updated: Chapter Bylaws
[Auto-Refresh] - No changes: Event Schedule
[Auto-Refresh] Completed: 1 doc(s) updated
```

#### B. Improved Change Detection
Enhanced the modification check to use **both** criteria:
- **Revision ID change**: `file.headRevisionId !== source.latest_revision_id`
- **Modified time change**: Compare timestamps
- Document is considered modified if **either** condition is true

This catches cases where Google might not update the revision ID immediately.

#### C. Better Error Handling
- Each document refresh is wrapped in try-catch
- Failures don't stop the polling loop
- Console logs show exactly which documents succeeded/failed

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Enhanced auto-refresh function with detailed logging
- `src/app/api/google/docs/refresh/route.ts` - Improved change detection logic

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Group Access Control:
1. Log in as User A with email `usera@example.com`
2. Create a new group "Test Group"
3. Invite `userb@example.com` to "Test Group"
4. Log out and log in as User B with `userb@example.com`
5. ✅ User B should see "Test Group"
6. Log in as User C with `userc@example.com` (not invited)
7. ✅ User C should NOT see "Test Group" (only default space)

### Test Member List:
1. Open Groups dialog (+Group button)
2. Select a group from "Your Groups"
3. ✅ Should see "Group Members" section below
4. ✅ Should display all invited members with their emails and roles

### Test Google Doc Polling:
1. Connect a Google Doc
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Wait 10 seconds for initial check
4. ✅ Should see: `[Auto-Refresh] Starting Google Docs auto-refresh check...`
5. Make a change in the Google Doc
6. Wait up to 2 minutes
7. ✅ Console should show: `[Auto-Refresh] ✓ Updated: [Doc Name]`
8. ✅ Search for content from the doc to verify it's updated

## Technical Details

### Database Queries
The group filtering uses this logic:
```sql
-- Get user's groups
SELECT space_id FROM app_user WHERE email = 'user@example.com'

-- Fetch only those groups
SELECT * FROM space WHERE id IN (space_ids) ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

### Polling Configuration
- **Initial delay**: 10 seconds after page load
- **Interval**: Every 2 minutes (120,000ms)
- **Overlap prevention**: Uses flag to prevent concurrent refreshes
- **Cleanup**: Cancels timers on component unmount

### Change Detection Logic
```javascript
const revisionChanged = file.headRevisionId !== source.latest_revision_id
const timeChanged = new Date(file.modifiedTime).getTime() > new Date(source.modified_time).getTime()
const isModified = revisionChanged || timeChanged
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Group Deletion**: Currently no UI to delete groups (can add if needed)
2. **Member Removal**: Currently no UI to remove members from groups (can add if needed)
3. **Polling Interval**: Fixed at 2 minutes (can be made configurable)
4. **Default Space Access**: Everyone has access to default space by design

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Real-time Updates**: Use WebSockets instead of polling
2. **Granular Permissions**: Add role-based access control (admin, member, viewer)
3. **Member Management**: Add UI to remove members from groups
4. **Group Settings**: Edit group name, transfer ownership
5. **Notifications**: Notify users when Google Docs are updated
